## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.  
2. Open a challenge folder (e.g., `2025-10-12-battle-of-words/`).  
3. Read the `README.md` to understand the challenge.  
4. Run `solution.py` to see the solution in action.  
5. Review test cases for validation.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 💡 Practice and improve Python problem-solving skills.  
- 📚 Maintain a structured, easy-to-navigate record of daily coding challenges.  
- 📈 Track progress over time with consistent daily practice.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The solutions in this repository are **my personal implementations** for practice and learning purposes.  

- They may **not be the most optimal or elegant solutions**.  
- The main goal is to **train problem-solving skills and improve Python proficiency**.  
- I may revisit challenges later to **refactor or optimize** the solutions.  

These exercises are meant to **practice coding, algorithmic thinking, and Python**, rather than to provide the *"perfect"* answer.
